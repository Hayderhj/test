## This is a standart react-create-app project 

In the project directory, use:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For this exercise I used a local state management relying on useReducer and Context.
Almost all the code(all?) is plaing JS, JSX, SCSS.
Used SASS (scss) for an easy style grouping, also used BEM for css navigavility 

Having more time i would like to setup a express server and do the node part to, also i would polish the ruling component, maybe sub divide it into smaller chunks.

Thanks for the oportunity and let me know if you have any questions.
